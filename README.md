# softwares  used to develop the program 

## HTML 

I will use this to prompt the user i.e it will provide the user with the buttons where he/she will be able to input different values .

## JAVASCRIPT 

I  will use this to write my programes 

##  prompt-snyc 

I will be require to use the command ' npm init' to install the package.json
I will also be required to use the command 'npm install prompt-sync' that will enable me to have the functionality of prompting on my terminal .

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
 ## function studentMarksGenerator() 

 ## SOLUTION STEPS

1 To solve this problem ,I am required to have a function 

2.The function must prompt the student to enter his/her marks i.e,this should be between 0-100

3.The next step is to check the validity of the marks entered whereby the marks should lie between 0-100 and must be a valid number.

4.Once the marks entered are valid .I should determine the grade of the students based on Marks.

5.To determine the grade I have used conditonal statements .The conditional statements I have used is if (){}else if (){} ,this is because the problem requires us to evaluate multiple conditions.

6.The output is displayed on the console using the alert function.


# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

 # function speedDetector()

## ## SOLUTION STEPS

1.To solve this problem, I begin by declaring and defining the variables.

2.I define a function called speedRegulator which prompts the user to enter the correct speed.

3.I store the entered speed by the user in a variable called speed

4.The entered speed must be converted to a number since I want to also validate the speed. 
    
5.I declared and define the exceededSpeed =Speed - speedLimit;

6.I also declare and define the demeritPoints.

7.I have used conditional statements to evaluate  I whether the the demerits are greater than 12 .if the demerits are greater than 12 .The driver gets his licenced cancelled else if the demerit points are less than 12 ,the program will only warn the driver.

8.The program will output in the console  through the alert function.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

## ## SOLUTION STEPS
 To solve this problem,I will write a program that calculates NET SALARY and it should be a Function to calculate and display net salary
 I will then conclude  by adding  an event listener to the calculate button that will prompt the user to enter the net salary and benefits .
